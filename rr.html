        <h3 id="heading">Description</h3>
        <p class="content">The basic structure of the robot consists of a metal chassis with a wooden board on top supported by four long bolts. All the electronics was sandwiched in between the chassis and wooden roof in order to protect it. The bot consists of four wheels with special rubber grip for better traction. High torque motors were used to provide drive in all four wheels to ensure that the bot navigates even the most difficult terrain with ease. The robot was designed with adequate ground clearance to maneuver rocky terrain effortlessly. 

Two L298N motor drivers were used to split the load of DC motors and provide drive in all four wheels. The robot was controlled wirelessly by a PlayStation controller which was configured using the PS2X library of Arduino. The communication between the transmitter and receiver was established using the PWM functionality of Arduino to receive digital as well as analog signals. </p>
