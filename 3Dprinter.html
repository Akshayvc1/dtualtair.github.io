        <h3 id="heading">Description</h3>
        <p class="content">It is a CNC machine that extrudes thin strands of PLA through a heated nozzle while traversing in all three axes to 3D print programmed parts. Possessing a wooden structure, it is extremely lightweight and easily transportable. Created in Prusa i3 configuration, the printer runs on five NEMA 17 stepper motors; four for movement in the three coordinate axes and one for extrusion of PLA. The nozzle and the bed on x and y axis respectively have belt drive while the movement in z-axis is facilitated through two lead screws. The printer was built at a third of the cost and has twice the print area compared to standard 3D printers available in the market. 

The basic electronics incorporated include Arduino Mega 2560, Ramps 1.4, A4988 Drivers and 12864 Full LCDRPIE30. The LCD screen allows us to explore and select from the various available print designs as well as display important parameters during print such as temperature, extrusion rate, print speed etc.

Parts are designed in CAD software which are then sliced using appropriate slicing software to create gcode file which is then used to 3D print the object. </p>
