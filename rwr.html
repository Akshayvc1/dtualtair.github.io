        <h3 id="heading">Description</h3>
        <p class="content">Weighing at 8.5 kilograms, the bot was created using an 18-gauge galvanized iron (GI) sheet and was controlled via DPDT switch. Even though its elongated wedge shape made it near impossible for the bot to be tumbled over, the design was such that the bot would be able to function in an upside-down orientation without any hindrances.
Axel extrusions, using 9 sharp blades of steel, were placed at the front of the bot and provided sheer damaging force to its opponents several of whom even withdrew from the competition in fear of their bots being ripped to shreds. The modified barrel mechanism was powered by a high-torque brushed DC motor, transmitting power via a timing belt. 
At the start of the wedge, just behind the teeth, two wheels, about 10cm in diameter, were attached to two 250 RPM motors, powered by an L298N motor driver. The botâ€™s simplistic, yet imaginative design helped us bag the runners-up prize for the competition. </p>
