        <h3 id="heading">Description</h3>
        <p class="content">With the specification to make as many soccerbots as possible, given that they fit a 50cm x 50cm starting square, Altair decided to make 4 optimally sized bots, each driven on 3 omni wheels, to give swift multi directional motion (like a soccer player) instead of a manually controlled differential drive. The capture mechanism on 3 of the robots was a door that shut down once the ball is in the cavity, controlled using a servo motor.
The goalkeeper was equipped with a special extended top to defend higher goals.
The striker had a striking mechanism, an amalgamation of a rack and pinion and a spring, giving it the ability to shoot at a very high speed. Every component of the mechanism was designed, prototyped and made by us in our own lab using our self-developed 3D printer. Our team was the only one having a shooting mechanism.
The Arduino mega along with 2 motor drivers and a 2400mAh LiPo battery, were used to connect and power the 3 DC motors, 1 servo motor and the Bluetooth connector for the controller. All the electronics were concealed within the two plates of the robot to provide protection and safety from clashes, making them sturdier.
All the development and ease in prototyping wouldnâ€™t have been possible without our 3D printer which gave us freedom to make as many iterations of a design to fit our exact needs at all times as needed. We even replaced the standard L-clamps for wheels with our self-designed and 3D printed motor clamps for tighter grip and better control. </p>
